- **Retry button on the server-unreachable screen**: A "Retry" button lets users re-attempt the connection without restarting the app (`AuthProvider.retryConnection()`)
- **Localization — Settings strings**: All hardcoded strings in the five Settings tabs are now in `app_en.arb` (~100 new keys covering Playback, Storage, About, Display, and Server sections)

### Changed

- **Now Playing screen**: Matrix transforms updated to Flutter 3.41-compatible `scaleByDouble`/`translateByDouble` signatures; `.withOpacity()` replaced with `.withValues(alpha:)` throughout

  - All options persisted to `SharedPreferences` and restored on next launch (awaited before `runApp`)
- **No-artwork placeholder in mobile player**: Songs without cover art now show a clean dark gradient tile with a music note icon and localised "No artwork" label instead of an infinite shimmer loader. Shimmer is still used while the image is actually fetching.

### Changed
- **Desktop player bar accent colors**: All active-state indicators (shuffle, repeat, progress slider, volume slider, favorite heart, lyrics button) now use Musly red
- **Update dialog colors**: Header gradient and download button changed from purple/blue (`#6C5CE7 → #00B4D8`) to Musly red/pink (`appleMusicRed → appleMusicPink`)
- **Desktop lyrics**: Lyrics view now uses `rootNavigator: true` so it covers the full window (sidebar + content + player bar); close button pops from the root navigator correctly
- **React marketing website**: Version number and release date in Hero and Download sections are now fetched live from the GitHub public API (`/repos/dddevid/Musly/releases/latest`) with a 10-minute session cache — no auth token required

### Fixed
- **Library list alignment**: Album/artist tiles in the Library screen now use an explicit `InkWell → Padding → Row` layout so artwork and text align with section headers on all platforms
- **Artwork settings not persisting**: `PlayerUiSettingsService.initialize()` is now `await`-ed before `runApp`, guaranteeing saved values are loaded into notifiers before any widget builds
